        <ol>
            <li>Combine condensed milk, cocoa, and 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan; bring to a 
                boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until brigadeiro mixture 
                thickens and pulls away from the bottom and sides when the pan is tilted, 10 to 15 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let brigadeiro mixture cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Scoop teaspoonfuls of the brigadeiro mixture and roll into balls with greased hands.</li>
            <li>Spread chocolate sprinkles on a shallow plate. Dip and roll brigadeiros in sprinkles.</li>
