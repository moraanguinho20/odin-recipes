    <p>
        A lovely lemon sorbet made with finely diced lemon peel and lemon juice. A great way

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lemon's peel, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup carbonated mineral water</li>
        <li>6 strips of lemon zest, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir diced lemon peel, 1 cup of water, and sugar together in a saucepan; bring to a 
            boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and 
            allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Stir lemon syrup with peel, lemon juice, and mineral water together in a pitcher or 
            bowl. Pour into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's 
            instructions. Garnish each serving with a twist of lemon peel.</li>
        <li>If you do not have an ice cream maker, you may freeze it in a tall canister. Freeze 
            for 1 ½ hours. Remove and stir with a whisk. Return to the freezer and stir about 
            once every hour for about 4 hours. The more times you stir, the more air will be 
            incorporated, resulting in a lighter finished product.</li>
    </ol>
