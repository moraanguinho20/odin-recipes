    <h2>Description</h2>
    This strawberry shortcake is the classic, biscuit-style shortcake — not the pound cake 
    variety. The cake is sliced in half and layered with sweet juicy strawberries and whipped 
    cream for a delicious summer treat!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup butter cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups whipped heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol></ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cake pan with 
            butter and lightly dust with flour.</li>
        <li>Slice the strawberries and toss them with 1/3 cup of white sugar. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, 1/4 cup of white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl; cut 
            in butter with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 
            Make a well in the center of mixture; add beaten egg, half-and-half, and 1 teaspoon 
            vanilla.  Stir mixture until just combined and no dry spots remain, being careful not 
            to mix too much.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter evenly into prepared cake pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean 
            and top is golden brown, about 18 minutes. Let cool partially in cake pan, about 10 
            minutes. Flip cake onto a clean work surface. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat heavy cream, powdered sugar, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla with an 
            electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut partially cooled cake in half horizontally, making 2 layers; set top layer aside. 
            Drain reserved strawberries in a colander placed over a small bowl, reserving any 
            juice. Brush strawberry juice evenly over top of bottom cake layer. Evenly arrange ½ 
            of the drained strawberries over bottom layer of cake.</li>
        <li>Spread ½ of whipped cream evenly over strawberries; place top cake layer over whipped 
            cream. Top with remaining strawberries and whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
